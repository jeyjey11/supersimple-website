            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Romeo Dellosa, and I am studying Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering at Sheridan College.<br>
                I developed a passion for design when I discovered Adobe XD, which is a tool for designing websites. This discovery motivated <br> 
                me to pursue this course and learn how to transform wireframes into code. Drawing from my knowledge of graphic design principles <br> 
                and trends, I create visually stunning designs that capture my audienceâ€™s attention. Whether it be web graphics, logos, or other <br> 
                types of digital assets, my work speaks for itself.

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>In this project, we are tasked with creating a connection between a database and Java code. The project description is to develop an app <br>
                     for a student record system. My teammate(Joshua Robinson) will be presenting to provide details about the entire project.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>In this project, we are tasked with creating a fully designed website mockup using Adobe XD. The project description involves designing a website<br> 
                    for movie search, similar to IMDb. However, on this website, users can search for any movie or TV show, and it will display the platforms where it is <br>
                     available for viewing. My team includes Sebastian Manife and David Freitas.</p>
